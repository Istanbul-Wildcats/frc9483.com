    <p class="about-content">
      Istanbul Wildcats is a robotics team consisting of students from all over
      the world and mentors studying at distinguished universities in Turkey to
      share their interest and focus on robotics.
      <br /><br />Our goal; To represent our country as the best FRC team in the
      world. <br /><br />Our Mission; To reach all the young minds who want to
      participate in FRC competitions in our country and set an example for them
      with our skills in the field of robotics, while at the same time preparing
      for the future together in our world that develops at an incredible pace
      every day. <br /><br />Our vision is to lead everyone we reach, both in
      Turkey and abroad, in the field of robotics and technology, while
      providing them with opportunities they could not even imagine, and to
      train the most equipped and prestigious engineers of the future.
      <br /><br />Our team was established as an independent team in 2023. Our
      mentors, who competed in different teams when they were high school
      students in Turkey, united and founded Istanbul Wildcats in order to
      develop FRC Turkey by transferring their experiences to the next
      generation and to represent Turkey as a leading robotics team worldwide.
      <br /><br />Our team currently consists of 5 mentors and 23 students. And
      at the end of each season, it opens applications to recruit new members
      for the team. Our team, which is not affiliated with any school or
      institution, sees this as an advantage and recruits members from all over
      Turkey and even the world. <br /><br />As a team, we aim to see robotics
      competitions as sports and attract the attention of young people and
      enable them to discover the potential of robotics. We have discovered that
      electronic sports (E-sports) are an important platform to achieve this
      goal and we emphasize the importance of traditional sports competition
      continuing in a more respectful environment in the world of e-sports.
      Istanbul Wildcats aims to be a pioneer for an innovative future by
      emphasizing the importance of the robotics branch in this transformation
      and combining technology and sports. For this purpose, we continue our
      work within Istanbul Wildcats, an E-sports team, and represent them in the
      field of robotics.
